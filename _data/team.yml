  bio: "Hi! My name is Jessica and I am in the third year of my PhD at the Center of Latin American Studies. Originally from Mexico City, I have been in the UK long enough to enjoy taking long country walks and drinking tea. I also love pottery, writing short stories and watching films. Before coming to Cambridge, I graduated in law, specialized in antitrust, regulation and politics, and lived in various countries. I am the MEXSOC Cultural Officer responsible for the organisation and running of the Symposium. My role on the Committee is to serve as its Chair, coordinate and support the work of its Sub-Committees, and liaise with authorities to ensure a successful event. I hope our Symposium contributes to foster debates, novel perspectives and collaborations among students, academics and practitioners that will benefit Mexico. I am here to listen and help, so I encourage you to get in touch if you have any questions or just want to chat. "

  bio: "¡Hola a todos! I am Aracely and currently a second year PhD student at the Gurdon Institute. I am passionate about learning how stem cells make cell-fate decisions during early development and how these decisions can impact on disease later in life. I was born and raised in the north of Mexico in the state of Chihuahua. Since then I have lived in different cities around Germany, the US and now I am enjoying my time in Cambridge. I was/ am the president of the CU Mexican Society. This role gave me the opportunity to organise ---together with Filo, Iván, Gustavo, Fernando and Guillermo--- several events to connect with Mexicans in Cambridge and to promote our culture with people in the UK and the vibrant international community in Cambridge. I believe the symposium is a great project and I am looking forward to welcoming Mexican students around the UK and Europe as well as people interested in our country;  learn from their research and discuss ideas together. Also, to embrace and listen from the leaders in their different disciplines invited as keynote speakers. I think our symposium will be an excellent platform for the discussion of ideas and hear from a multidisciplinary point of view. I feel honoured to be able to contribute to this project. I firmly believe Mexico is a fantastic country, having a rich culture, kind people, incredible variety of climates and biodiversity and one of the best gastronomies in the world, sounds lit, isn't it? I also think the many problems of our nation can be fixed/improved and that solving them is a responsibility of all Mexicans in the country and abroad. My role in the symposium is as coordinator of the Academic and Keynote Speakers committee, together with Iván, Annie and Fernando we are responsible for choosing, inviting and welcoming our keynote speakers. If you have any suggestions for invited speakers or any other comments, please get in touch!"

My biggest dream is to live in a world of equal opportunities for all. I have a compulsive addiction to cake and “tea time”. I’m honoured and excited to contribute organising this symposium within the Academic and Students Affairs Committee. I hope that by organising this event we will contribute to the integration of  disciplines to bring solutions to Mexico’s pressing problems. If you are interested in sharing your academic work in the Symposium do not hesitate to email me pv296@cam.ac.uk. My favourite thing about Mexico it’s the capacity of its people to enjoy life and strive, and to fill everything with colours and a sense of connectedness with each other."

  bio: "Hi, my name is Ana Laura, I was born in Mexico City and lived there until I decided to move to Cambridge (already two years ago!). I studied Psychology in UNAM and I was mainly interested in learning about Neuropsychology and the social learning of children. I was part of different research groups in UNAM where I worked with young people with autism and investigated productive social interactions between teachers and students. The latter gave me the opportunity of collaborating with academics from the University of Cambridge which, later on, inspired me to study an MPhil in Psychology and Education in their exceptional university. Now, I am doing a PhD in Education in the University of Cambridge, investigating an adjusted way of teaching children with autism in primary schools. I want to find out more about how the classroom dialogue can be adjusted to the needs of these children and provide opportunities for their voices to be heard. Besides doing research, I love singing and I am a big fan of musical theatre. I seize every opportunity I have to sing with friends and family!  I am involved in the logistics of the symposium, looking for great places in the University that can host the activities of the event and making sure that it runs smoothly. If you have any suggestions or questions, you can contact me at alt56@cam.ac.uk. I am excited to be part of the organizing committee of the symposium and help building stronger relationships between Mexican researchers in the UK."

Having the opportunity to do research at a very young stage in my degree made me realise I wanted to work in academia, this is why now I am pursuing a PhD at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute in the University of Cambridge. I am very fond of watching interesting films and learning new languages! My role in this team is to coordinate the cherished social events at the symposium. I am looking forward to participating in this event because of the extremely valuable connections we seek to create between Mexicans in the UK and in Mexico."

  bio: "My name is Sarah Abel, and I like to think I'm British by birth but Mexican at heart. I grew up near Sheffield in the UK, and went to Cambridge to study a bachelor’s degree in French and Spanish (2011), and then an MPhil in Latin American Studies (2012). More recently, I completed a social anthropology PhD at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris (2016), and I am currently doing a postdoc at the University of Iceland – although I live most of the time in Cambridge. Studying and experiencing other societies is the part of my research that I love best, and I am fortunate that my studies have allowed me to travel to and live in lots of different places, including Ecuador, Spain, Cuba, France, Brazil, USA, and Iceland. While doing my PhD I also met my husband, who introduced me to his home country, Mexico, where I plan to live some day. I am thrilled to be part of the organizing committee for the Symposium, which I think is a fantastic opportunity to strengthen academic and cultural bonds between Mexico and the UK – a project I feel passionate about. My role on the committee is to help with English translation and proofreading."

  bio: "My interest to understand how cells make decisions motivated me to start my PhD in Bioinformatics working with protein phosphorylation. During this journey, I study how kinases sense and process biological information to regulate cellular functions, to achieve this task I use statistical models. Before my PhD, I obtained my bachelor degree on Genomic Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I enjoy reading texts that cover discussions of the implications of science in our lives and I also like reading poetry, novels, and discussions about the evolution of the Internet. The digital world has had a strong influence in my education and I desire to contribute with projects to make science and knowledge more accessible, and create communities that empower people respecting their rights to navigate an inclusive and decentralized internet. My hobbies include to attend film festivals, travel, make parties, talk to people, read about random topics, and dance. The multicultural community of Cambridge and its academic diversity keeps me learning all the time, so it is an honor to work with other mexican and international students to organize this symposium. I hope we get lots of inspiration and contribute to face the challenges of the present and the future. I will be helping on the digital tasks of the project. Hope you enjoy navigating our website!"

I obtained my BSc in Biotechnology Engineering from Tec de Monterrey (Estado de Mexico) in 2015. Later, I was granted a Gates Scholarship to come to Cambridge and pursue an MPhil in Genomics, which I completed in 2017. I am currently a PhD student at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge where I use genomics to study the immune system. My research tries to understand why certain people are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases, and to identify potential drug targets.  I am passionate about education and science outreach (sharing knowledge being my favourite activity) and I also enjoy literature, music, art and learning languages. My two biggest dreams are to bring together science and art, and to help building cutting-edge research in Mexico and Latin America.  My role in the Symposium is to provide attendees with a variety of social events and activities. Through these activities attendees will experience student life in Cambridge in a fun way, while also getting to know the city and its history. I look forward to this event, which is an extremely valuable space for any Mexicans doing research outside of their country, and I hope it can help them build bridges with other Mexicans and with the world. If you are planning to attend and have any questions, feel free to contact me by email."
