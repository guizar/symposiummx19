<p align='left'>Hi! My name is Jessica and I am in the third year of my PhD at the Center of Latin American Studies. Originally from Mexico City, I have been in the UK long enough to enjoy taking long country walks and drinking tea. I also love pottery, writing short stories and watching films. Before coming to Cambridge, I graduated in law, specialised in antitrust, regulation and politics, and lived in various countries. I am the MEXSOC Cultural Officer responsible for the organisation and running of the Symposium. My role on the Committee is to serve as its Chair, coordinate and support the work of its Sub-Committees, and liaise with authorities to ensure a successful event. I hope our Symposium contributes to foster debates, novel perspectives and collaborations among students, academics and practitioners that will benefit Mexico. I am here to listen and help, get in touch if you have any questions or just want to chat.<br>

<p align='left'>&#xA1;Hola a todos! I am Aracely and I am currently a second year PhD student at the Gurdon Institute. I am passionate about learning how stem cells make cell-fate decisions during early development and how these decisions can have an impact on diseases later in life.<br>
I was born and raised in the north of Mexico in the state of Chihuahua. Since then I have lived in different cities around Germany and the US, and now I am enjoying my time in Cambridge. I was the president of the CU Mexican Society, a role that gave me the opportunity to organise &#x2013; together with Filo, Iv&#xE1;n, Gustavo, Fernando and Guillermo &#x2013; several events to help connect with Mexicans in Cambridge and to promote our culture among people in the UK and the vibrant international community in Cambridge.</p>
<p align='left'>I believe the symposium is a great project and I am looking forward to welcoming Mexican students around the UK and Europe as well as people interested in our country, and to learn from their research and discuss our ideas together. Also, I look forward to embracing and hearing from the leaders in different disciplines who are invited as keynote speakers. I think our symposium will be an excellent platform for discussing ideas and hearing from multidisciplinary points of view. I feel honoured to be able to contribute to this project.</p>
<p align='left'>I firmly believe Mexico is a fantastic country, with a rich culture, kind people, an incredible variety of climates and biodiversity, and one of the best gastronomies in the world &#x2013; sounds amazing, right? I also think the many problems of our nation can be fixed and improved, and that solving them is the responsibility of all Mexicans, both at home and abroad. My role in the symposium is as coordinator of the Academic and Keynote Speakers committee, and together with Iv&#xE1;n, Annie and Fernando we are responsible for choosing, inviting and welcoming our keynote speakers. If you have any suggestions for invited speakers or any other comments, please get in touch!<br>

<p align='left'>Hi,</p>
<p align='left'>My name is Ana Laura, I was born in Mexico City and lived there until I decided to move to Cambridge (already two years ago!). I studied Psychology at the UNAM and I was mainly interested in learning about Neuropsychology and the social learning of children. I was part of different research groups in the UNAM where I worked with young people with autism and investigated productive social interactions between teachers and students. This gave me the opportunity to collaborate with academics from the University of Cambridge, which later on inspired me to study an MPhil in Psychology and Education at this exceptional university. Now I am doing a PhD in Education at the University of Cambridge, investigating a different way of teaching children with autism in primary schools. I want to find out more about how dialogue in the classroom can be adjusted to the needs of these children, and to provide opportunities for their voices to be heard. Besides doing research, I love singing and I am a big fan of musical theatre. I seize every opportunity I have to sing with friends and family!</p>
<p align='left'>I am involved in the logistics of the symposium, looking for great places in the University that can host our activities and making sure that the event runs smoothly. If you have any suggestions or questions, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:alt56@cam.ac.uk">alt56@cam.ac.uk</a>. I am excited to be part of the organising committee of the symposium and helping build stronger relationships between Mexican researchers in the UK.<br>

<p align='left'>Hello everyone, my name is Fernando. I was born in Mexico City and have lived most of my life in Estado de M&#xE9;xico. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tecnol&#xF3;gico de Monterrey CEM. There I spent many hours in the Electraton team where we designed and built electric karts for competition. I also became really interested in Materials Science while working on a research project focused on plasma-assisted treatments of surfaces for enhanced mechanical and tribological properties. I then moved to the United Kingdom to study an MSc in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Sheffield, continuing my research in plasma nitriding. I then moved again, this time to the beautiful city of Cambridge, for a PhD in Materials Science and Metallurgy. Working in the Rolls-Royce UTC research group, I now devote my time to understanding and modelling the multiple deformation mechanisms that take place in nickel-based superalloys, materials used for applications at high temperatures such as in the hot stages of jet engines. Other than that, I like spending my time doing other activities, including dancing (salsa and bachata mostly), listening to music, playing chess and board games, reading and going to the pub with friends. My role in the Symposium will be as a part of the Keynote Speaker subcommittee. Please do not hesitate to contact me.<br>

<p align='left'>Hi everyone! My name is Estelle. I was born and raised in Belgium but chilanga by heart after an exchange at the UNAM (Mexico city). I am currently enrolled in a Mphil in Archaeological Science in Cambridge. My dissertation is focusing on the identification and comparison of faunal remains from two Maya sites in Belize in order to understand trade and relationships during the Maya Classic Period. Passionate about archaeology, history of art and heritage, I have a particular interest for Mesoamerican cultures. A master in gender studies also allowed me to work with Indigenous women in Oaxaca and bring together my interest for feminist questions and the mexican socio-political context. I am thrilled to be part of the organization of the symposium through the art exhibition committee together with Roberto and Karla. Promoting mexican culture and their talented artists is for me a very exciting task. Get in touch to chat about feminism, archaeology, fair fashion around a beer (yes, I am still Belgian)!</p>

<p align='left'>My name is Eddie Cano Gamez. I was born and raised in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, where I spent my happiest days reading novels or sitting by the shade of an old church. I obtained my BSc in Biotechnology Engineering from Tec de Monterrey (Estado de Mexico) in 2015. Later, I was granted a Gates Scholarship to come to Cambridge and pursue an MPhil in Genomics, which I completed in 2017. I am currently a PhD student at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, where I use genomics to study the immune system. My research tries to understand why certain people are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases, and it also looks at identifying potential drug targets. I am passionate about education and science outreach (sharing knowledge being my favourite activity) and I also enjoy literature, music, art and learning languages. My two biggest dreams are to bring together science and art, and to help building cutting-edge research in Mexico and Latin America.</p>
<p align='left'>My role in the Symposium is to provide attendees with a variety of social events and activities. Through these activities attendees will experience student life in Cambridge in a fun way, while also getting to know the city and its history. I look forward to this event, which is an extremely valuable space for any Mexicans doing research outside of their country, and I hope it can help them build bridges with other Mexicans and with the world. If you are planning to attend and have any questions, feel free to contact me by email.<br>

<p align='left'>It was my interest in understanding how cells make decisions that motivated me to start my PhD in Bioinformatics, working with protein phosphorylation. During this journey, I have been studying how kinases sense and process biological information to regulate cellular functions, and I use statistical models to achieve this. Before my PhD, I obtained my bachelor degree in Genomic Sciences at the UNAM. I enjoy reading texts that cover discussions of the implications of science in our lives and I also like reading poetry, novels, and discussions about the evolution of the Internet. The digital world has had a strong influence on my education and my aim is to contribute to projects that make science and knowledge more accessible, and to creating communities that empower people, while respecting their rights to navigate an inclusive and decentralised internet. My hobbies include attending film festivals, traveling, throwing parties, talking to people, reading on random topics, and dancing. The multicultural community of Cambridge and its academic diversity keeps me learning all the time, so it is an honour to work with other Mexican and international students to organise this symposium. I hope we gain lots of inspiration and can contribute to facing the challenges of the present and the future. I will be helping out with the digital side of the project.

<p align='left'>Morning! I am Cristina, a Mexican passionate about the sea and the interactions between human and non-human animals. I am about to finish my PhD in Animal Welfare &amp; Evolutionary Biology at the Department of Veterinary Medicine. I lost track of where I am from, but I spent my “key-years” (sensitive periods) between Quintana Roo and Cuernavaca, Morelos. During my adult years I have also moved around. I first did a degree in contemporary jewellery in Italy, since I have always been fond of art. Back in Mexico, I developed as a non-human animal trainer and research assistant. This led me to several anthrozoological questions and the need for a related degree. I studied biology in Cuernavaca, molecular genetics in Argentina, Interdisciplinary Sciences in France, conservation in Greece, Philosophy and Statistics in Paris, moved to Australia, and then came to the UK. I strongly believe in Mexico and think that this Symposium plays a part in the advancement of the country. My role is to implement the operation of the Symposium, as part of the logistics team. Even if Cambridge provides already an extraordinary setting for this meeting, our team is taking care of the details! Hope to see you here <em>Challenging ideas about Mexico and the World</em>!
